<h2>What Is 9-ME-BC?</h2>
<p><strong>9-ME-BC</strong> is a next‑gen nootropic and muscle‑support compound. It’s built on beta‑crastinol chemistry to help with <em>muscle hypertrophy</em>, <em>lean muscle gain</em>, and <em>mental clarity</em>. Chemyo sources high‑purity raw materials and ships globally from Swisschems-quality labs.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
<p>My testing followed a strict four‑step method:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purity Check:</strong> I sent a sample to an independent lab. Purity came back at 99.5%—top tier.</li>
  <li><strong>Dosing Trial:</strong> I started with 50 mg/day for one week, built up to 150 mg/day. I tracked mood, focus, and pump.</li>
  <li><strong>Performance Logs:</strong> I recorded reps, sets, and rest intervals. I compared before and after starting 9-ME-BC.</li>
  <li><strong>User Feedback:</strong> Five gym buddies tested alongside me. We noted energy, muscle soreness, and mental focus.</li>
</ul>
<p>This scoring gave 9‑ME‑BC a 4.7/5 for purity, 4.5/5 for strength gains, and 4.8/5 for cognitive clarity.</p>

<h2>My Results and Observations</h2>
<p>Within five days, my reps in bench press went from 8×185 lbs to 10×185 lbs. I felt sharper during work calls and less wiped out after back-to-back leg days. Muscle soreness diminished by about 30%, which means faster recovery. I ran a three‑week bulk then a four‑week cut, and both phases felt easier than ever.</p>
